Here’s a step-by-step guide to installing Node.js on Windows:

### 1. **Download Node.js Installer for Windows**

- Go to the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
- You'll see two versions available:
    - **LTS (Long Term Support)**: Recommended for most users, especially for production use.
    - **Current**: The latest features, but it may have less stability.

  Choose the version that suits your needs (LTS is a good starting point) and click the corresponding download link for the Windows Installer (`.msi`).

### 2. **Run the Node.js Installer**

Once the installer is downloaded:

- Locate the `.msi` file in your downloads and double-click it to run the installer.
- The Node.js Setup Wizard will appear. Click **Next** to continue.

### 3. **Accept the License Agreement**

- Read the license agreement and, if you agree, check the box next to **"I accept the terms in the License Agreement"**.
- Click **Next**.

### 4. **Choose Installation Path**

- By default, Node.js will install to `C:\Program Files\nodejs\`. You can choose a different path if needed, but it's generally fine to leave this as is.
- Click **Next**.

### 5. **Select Components**

- The default options are usually fine for most users:
    - **Node.js runtime**: Required for running Node.js applications.
    - **npm package manager**: This will install `npm`, which is the package manager for JavaScript used to install libraries and packages.
    - **Add to PATH**: This adds Node.js and `npm` to your system's environment variables, so you can run them from the command line without specifying their full paths.

  Make sure **"Add to PATH"** is selected (it should be by default), then click **Next**.

### 6. **Install Node.js**

- Click **Install** to begin the installation process.
- If prompted by Windows User Account Control (UAC), click **Yes** to allow the installer to make changes to your device.

### 7. **Complete the Installation**

- Once the installation is finished, you will see a confirmation screen. Click **Finish**.

### 8. **Verify Installation**

To verify that Node.js and `npm` have been installed correctly, open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell** and run the following commands:

- **Verify Node.js:**

  ```bash
  node -v
  ```

  This should display the version of Node.js that you installed, for example:

  ```
  v20.x.x
  ```

- **Verify npm:**

  ```bash
  npm -v
  ```

  This will display the installed version of `npm`, for example:

  ```
  9.x.x
  ```

### 9. **Optional: Update npm (if needed)**

Sometimes the version of `npm` bundled with Node.js may not be the latest. To update `npm` to the latest version, run:

```bash
npm install -g npm
```

This installs the latest version of `npm` globally.

### 10. **Optional: Install Node Version Manager (nvm) for Windows**

If you want to manage multiple versions of Node.js on your system, you can install **nvm (Node Version Manager)** for Windows. This allows you to switch between different Node.js versions easily.

To install `nvm`:

1. Download the Windows version of **nvm** from the [nvm-windows GitHub repository](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases).
2. Install it following the instructions from the repository.
3. Once installed, you can install specific Node.js versions and switch between them.

That’s it! You now have Node.js and `npm` installed on your Windows machine. Let me know if you need any help with setup or running Node.js projects.
